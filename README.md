# Enhancing_VPN_Security_A_Comparative_Study_of_LSTM_and_GRU_Models
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have emerged as a key element to maintaining internet security and anonymity in an increasingly networked society. With the rapid development of cyber-attacks and the need for safe communication links, VPNs offer a reliable way to protect internet traffic with encryption and mask users' identities. However, the effectiveness of VPNs in ensuring security and privacy is not absolute, given that vulnerabilities could stem from differences in technologies, protocols, and implementations. Such diversity necessitates rigorous testing approaches to effectively measure VPN reliability and security.
